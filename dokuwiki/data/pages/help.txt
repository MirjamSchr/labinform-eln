The LabInform ELN is divided into sections at the top level, each of which is grouped together again. Each area is represented by its own symbol.

The individual sections can also be accessed from the sidebar on the left. Within the individual areas there are basically overview pages, which serve the navigation.

For each area there is an explanation like this one, which can be expanded.

New here? The **[[:intro:|general introduction]]** is certainly a good starting point to get warm with the ELN component of LabInform. For a more detailed documentation of the Labinform ELN for users, administrators, and developers, have a look at [[https://eln.docs.labinform.de/]].
