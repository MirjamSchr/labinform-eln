====== Calculations ======

//A calculation is always carried out on a [[..:geometries:|geometry]] that in turn belongs to a  [[..:molecules:|molecule]]. A geometry optimisation is a calculation based on an initial geometry, but resulting in a new geometry that needs to be entered manually as new [[..:geometries:|geometry]].//

**Hint:** Calculations are **numbered subsequently** regardless of the geometries they are based upon.


===== Create new calculation entry =====

For "geometry" enter the ID of the respective [[..:geometries:|geometry]] the calculation is based upon. The list for "type" provides short and concise descriptions.
