====== Molecules ======

//A "molecule" is always the starting point of a  [[..:geometries:|geometry]] that in turn is used to perform calculation upon.//


===== Create new molecule entry =====

A molecule always has a name that is as meaningful as possible. If for a given molecule there exists a real (physically present) [[..:..:samples:batches:|batch]] that was used as starting point for [[..:..:samples:samples:|samples]] that usually were measured in some way or other, you can optionally add the ID of this [[..:..:samples:batches:|batch]].
