====== Geometries ======

//A geometry is a structure (coordinates) that is used to calculate upon. Each geometry belongs to a [[..:molecules:|molecule]]. A geometry optimisation is performed on a starting geometry and results in another, new geometry that is added using the form below.//

**Hint:** Geometries are numbered subsequently, regardless of the molecules the belong to.


===== Create new geometry entry =====

For "molecule" enter the ID of the associated [[..:molecules:|molecule]], for "description" provide a concise (and unique) string containing information about the conformation (*e.g.*, "cis-cis") as well as the spin multiplicity (singlet, doublet, triplet) and whether the geometry has been optimised or not.
