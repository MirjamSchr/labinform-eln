 ====== Syntheses ======

//Own synthesis of a substance//


<WRAP center round important 100%>
Syntheses need to be designed and decided upon how to include them here in the LabInform ELN. Some key concepts may include:

  * One synthesis will be described on one page
  * Syntheses can be based on batches
  * Syntheses result in a batch of material (that needs to be added manually to the list of batches)
  * Syntheses will most probably use templates via the snippet plugin for recurring building blocks of the description
  * We need some way to associate (external) analytical measurements with a synthesis
