  * There is an associated lab book page for each measurement.
  * The lab book pages are generated via a form and sorted by measurement method.
  * There is a data block at the top of the lab book page.
  * As soon as an entry of this data block changes between two measurements, a new lab book page is created (note that this is not done automatically, but needs to be done by the user).
